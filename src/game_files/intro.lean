# What is this game?
This game tries to show you that real math can be done in the Lean theorem prover.

This game builds on 
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" target="blank">the natural number game</a>.
The levels in this game need to be solved using tactics. To learn how to use these tactics, I would
recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "Advanced Proposition world". I will
not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural number game here.
Blue nodes on the graph are ones that you are ready to enter. Grey nodes you should stay away
from -- try blue ones higher up the chain first. Green nodes are completed.
# Thanks
